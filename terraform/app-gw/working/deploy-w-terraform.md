## Deploy Demo Environment for Microsoft Azure Administrator: Manage Storage Accounts
The demo environment for the course will require a Microsoft Azure subscription. You can use an existing subscription you have or you can try [Azure for Free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

The demo environment uses Azure Bastion, which is expensive to run all the town, so you will want to delete the resource group when completed with the demos.

Because the environment uses terraform, you will need some understanding of deploying Azure resources with Terraform. Use the following link for information on [deploying terraform in Azure with Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell)
