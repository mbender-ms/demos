## Applicable Exams
It is important to understand that Microsoft has taken up the practice of retiring and replacing exams at a much faster pace than in the past. To illustrate this, the Azure Administrator Associate certification is in its third version of the exam (fourth if you include the brief existence of the AZ-102 transition exam for candidates who have taken Exam 70-533: Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions). Currently, to achieve this certification you must pass the AZ-104 exam. The price is exactly the same but the newer exam should be your choice.
