# Mentoring Loop for Microsoft Certification Paths

In early fall of 2023, I'll be running a mentoring loop for Microsoft Certification Paths. The focus will be around [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://aka.ms/mentoraz900). I'll be posting more detailed information as we get closer to the event.

For now, please let me know your interest by submitting your contact information via [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/4pgjric5aG). I'll be in touch with you soon.
## What is a Mentoring Loop?

The purpose of the mentoring loop is to help you get started on your journey to Microsoft Certification. The mentoring loop is a series of meetings where we will discuss the certification path you are interested in, and how to get started. We will also discuss the resources available to you, and how to use them to your advantage.

We won't be covering the actual certification exam material, but we will be covering the resources available to you to help you prepare for the exams. The purpose being to provide you a re-usable framework for studying for any Microsoft Certification exam, or any other certification exam for that matter.
