      2. You've probably seen the negative side-effects of multitasking--like decreased efficiency and more errors--first hand. Recently, researchers have quantified some of those effects. They found that most professionals only spend an average of one minute and fifteen seconds on a task before some kind of interruption. And after an interruption, it can take up to 25 minutes to resume the task. [ref](https://www.inc.com/laura-montini/infographic/the-high-cost-of-multitasking.html)
   4. Remember the Zeigarnik Effect
      1. The “Zeigarnik Effect” is the principle that unfinished tasks are harder to get out of your brain than are tasks that haven’t been started. This means that starting a project — even if you work on it for just 10 minutes — will make it harder for your brain to forget or dismiss it. If you find yourself daydreaming instead of getting started, set a timer for 10 minutes and do something (anything!) during that time. Once you start, the big, scary project will turn into an unfinished task — meaning your brain will latch onto it and figure out how to get it done.
