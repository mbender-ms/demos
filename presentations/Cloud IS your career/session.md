# Your Career IS the Cloud...Let's Get There!

## Description

Cloud IS the buzz word of the day. Many of us are tired of it, but we know it is the end state. Your career depends on you being successful in the cloud, whether your company is there or not. In this session, you'll learn how to learn how to get the skills you need, in the time you have, and level up for the next opportunity. You'll still have to do the hard work, but I'll help you with the tools you need to make the change happen.

## Notes

Soft Skills talks are my happy place and where I excel.

While I've worked for Microsoft, build cloud content at Pluralsight, and have mentored 1000's at Madison College, I'm not a deep technical speaker. Never have been; never will be. What I am is someone who understands how learning works, and how to get the best out of people. If I can help someone to learn, I have helped them, their families, and their community.

I'm a generalist who truly believes each and every person who attends a session is there for a reason. I get nervous every time I speak. Not because I have to speak but because I worry I won't give the audience what they came for. I over-prepare and deliver too much. Because it's hard out there, and each person who comes to my session deserves everything I have to give them. I will always feel like my presentation could have been better.

Soft skills talk are hard because you have to be open. You have to be vulnerable. Most technical speakers have a problem with that because you can't cover anything up with stuff people don't know or understand. I don't because it's never about me when I take the stage. It's about the audience. I'm there for them to learn, grow, and excel. My faults and failures are learning opportunities for them. I do this because giving back is how you thank those who helped pave your way.
