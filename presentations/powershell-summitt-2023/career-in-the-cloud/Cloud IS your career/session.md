Whether your company is there or not. your career depends on you being successful in the cloud,  In this session, you'll learn the skills you need, in the time you have, and how to level up for the next opportunity. Life long learning is the key. You'll still have to do the hard work, but I'll help you with the tools you need to make the change happen. 

## Notes

Soft Skills talks are my happy place and where I excel.

While I've worked for Microsoft, build cloud content at Pluralsight, and have mentored 1000's at Madison College, I'm not a deep technical speaker. Never have been; never will be. What I am is someone who understands how learning works, and how to get the best out of people. If I can help someone to learn, I have helped them, their families, and their community.

I'm a generalist who truly believes each and every person who attends a session is there for a reason. I get nervous every time I speak. Not because I have to speak but because I worry I won't give the audience what they came for. I over-prepare and deliver too much. Because it's hard out there, and each person who comes to my session deserves everything I have to give them. I will always feel like my presentation could have been better.

Soft skills talk are hard because you have to be open. You have to be vulnerable. Most technical speakers have a problem with that because you can't cover anything up with stuff people don't know or understand. I don't because it's never about me when I take the stage. It's about the audience. I'm there for them to learn, grow, and excel. My faults and failures are learning opportunities for them. I do this because giving back is how you thank those who helped pave your way.

## Rough Outline

## Intro

1. What you need to leave this session with:
    1. You need to learn a cloud...but that won't happen today.
        1. We'll start the plan and building the foundation. The house is up to you.
    1. You need to be a solution provider besides just a problem solver.
    1. You need to own your cloud career...but that won't be driven by your employer.
    1. Network, Network, Network this week.
        1. The inter-personal kind, not 1s and 0s
    1. I'll give a truckload of resources; you have to unload it.

## Cloud in 2 minutes

The cloud is a scalable and flexible set of tools for you to run your organizations without worry about hardware on the Server side.

Let's talk about where we've come from and where we'll go:
1. On premises was a 1:1 relationship between hardware and applications. If you had a web application, that was the only thing running on it. This led to server sprawl and datacenters the size of city blocks for companies. Also, It cause you to be responsible for everything from the hardware up.
1. Then came virtualization. This reduced the Physical server footprint in some cases but it still required hardware, and is some cases really expensive storage (aka SAN or storage area networks.) While some people save money with virtualization. Most didn't. However, they did gain things like higher reliability and scalability which where hard or near impossible/affordable in the physical server world.
1. That brings us to the cloud. In the cloud, you no longer worry about hardware infrastructure. Everything is software based. And you get to choose how much or how little you have to manage.
1. It's flexible in that you can deploy or undeploy services at will. costs are based on what you use not what you bought.
    1. For example, Exchange Server vs Exchange Online
    1. Bought it
## Big Point #1: You need to understand OpEx vs CapEx

1. Traditional IT runs on operating expenses and depreciating capital.
1. Cloud runs on IT as an operating expense. So this is not just an IT issue to solve; Your CFO is just as important as you CIO in driving cloud usage.

## Major Flavors of Cloud Services

1. Diagram of Physical/IaaS/Paas/Saas
1. [Azure Services Overview](https://azurecharts.com/overview/?f=.)
1. Let's look at an example
    1. Guac as a Service
1. Common Cloud Services
    1. Public Cloud - Azure, AWS, GCP and a few others
    1. Saas - M365, Salesforce, NetSuite, Quickbooks
    1. And the 1000's of other things like backups, security products, and more.

## Cloud Fundamentals - What you need to know

1. Insert list from word doc
1. You need to know the core

## Know the Basics

1. Explore services
    1.[Azure Terminal](https://aztty.azurewebsites.net/?d=services&f=Networking)
1. Networking
    1. This can determine success and failure in the cloud.
    1. For Iaas/Paas like Azure, networking is more complex and more security focused than you may have on prem.
1. Compute
    1. Beyond VMs, containers provide a basis going forward.
    1. Linux is and will continue to grow as the most deployed OS in the cloud. You should know it.
1. Storage
    1. Another key component.
    1. It goes beyond just storing stuff on a disc.
    1. Understanding how storage works, what types of storage work for what situations, and how to solve problems with it.
1. Management
    1. Things like Azure Policy, Azure AD and Role Based Access Control are critical.
1. If you are a Microsoft Shop, don't forget about M365.
1. Security
    1. Where to start...
1. Be a solution provider
    1. As more work because busy work, you need to be able to provide solutions; not just put out fires.
    1. You want a seat at the table. And when it happens, you need to be able to deliver.
    1. Look at ways to improve your current org.
        1. Example:
            1. You have an aging document infrastructure, your SAN is old, and your backup software needs new licenses.
            1. How would you solve this to future-proof your org?
            1. Azure File Share, Azure File Sync, and Azure Backup
1. Learn Generative AI and how to ask good questions
    1. Copilots will take over workload, and you need to be ready.
    1. You need to know how to ask the right questions, and get the right information
1. Demo of Azure OpenAI

## How to learn in the digital age

1. Why certifications are your route to success
    1. In the MS world, our certs have gotten better.
    1. They provide a great framework for you to learn job-specific skills.
    1. Start with Cloud Fundamentals and work up. 
1. Use the cloud vendor's docs to your advantage
