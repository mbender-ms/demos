# Welcome to the Resource Repository for Microsoft Azure Administrator: Manage Storage Accounts on [Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-administrator-manage-storage-account)

## Disclaimer: All demo code is provide as a reference and is not to be used in a production environment. Let's be careful out there!!

## How to Use

Below you will find links to references from the course and additional references you may find helpful. Also, more detailed instructions for deploying a demo environment for the course with terraform will be included at a later date.

If you want to give it a shot on your own, use deploydemo-msa.tf from the exercise file download

I recommend using Azure Cloud Shell. It has terraform already installed. Simply copy deploydemo-msa.tf into your clouddrive, and run the commands listed in the .tf file's references.
